First you have to compile googletest and googlemock. Just cd to the googletest-master/googlemock/gtest/
folder and execute 'make'. Do the same inside googletest-master/googlemock/make as well.

You can always compile them using cmake.

Then, by executing 'make' inside the parent folder, you can see gtest running all tests.
